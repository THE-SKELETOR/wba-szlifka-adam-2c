                    Skeletor is the main antagonist of the Masters of the Universe franchise, and is the most dangerous
                    threat on Eternia. His only goal is power, and to that end, he will not rest until he possesses the
                    secrets of Castle Grayskull, which will enable him to become master of the universe. This places him
                    in direct conflict with the only man powerful enough to stop him, He-Man.
                    <br><br>
                    Skeletor was initially presented simply as an evil demon from another dimension, and in general, his
                    origins were not as important as his evil motives. However, the introduction of Hordak as Skeletor's
                    former teacher provided a brief glimpse into a past. Near the end of the original Masters of the
                    Universe franchise. It was hinted that Skeletor might have once been Keldor, the brother of He-Man's
                    father, King Randor. The development of Skeletor's backstory as a dashing, ambitious villain played
                    heavily into his characterization in the 2002 relaunch of the franchise.
                    <br><br>
                    Skeletor was one of only a handful of characters that carried over to The New Adventures of He-Man
                    brand. In this, He-Man was sent to the far future to help the Galactic Guardians save the last of
                    humanity from the Evil Mutants. Skeletor follows his enemy and offers his services to the Mutants
                    simply because he must rid the universe of He-Man.
